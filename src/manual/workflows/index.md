title: Workflows
author: Olle Hellman

This series of workflows are writtin as a combination of instructions and tutorials. This software package is easy to use, but the underlying physics are not trivial. There are some deliberate barriers introduced as attempts to force a good understanding from the user. I am expecting limited success.

The minimal examples should be done first, that each deal with fundamental parts:

1. [Example 1](minimal_example_1.html): will get you started and plot some stuff.
2. [Example 2](minimal_example_2.html): basic MD input preparation.
3. [Example 3](minimal_example_3.html): stochastic input preparation.
4. [Example 4](minimal_example_4.html): free energy.
5. [Example 5](minimal_example_5.html): thermal conductivity.
6. [Example 6](minimal_example_6.html): properties as a function of temperature.

With that taken care, I plan to add proper examples of projects with production quality data. Dig up some old stuff I already published.
